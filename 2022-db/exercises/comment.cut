\extraspacing {\bf Answer:} Call a vertex of $G$ {\em small} if its degree is at most $\sqrt{m}$; otherwise, call it {\em large}. The number of large vertices is at most $2m / \sqrt{m} = 2\sqrt{m}$. We divide the triangles into two types:
\myenums{
    \item At least one vertex $u$ is small, whereas the other vertices $v$ and $w$ can be small or large. There are at most $m^{1.5}$ triangles of this type. First, choose an edge $\set{u,v}$ with (at least) one small vertex $u$; there are $m$ ways to do so. For each $\set{u, v}$, there are at most $\sqrt{m}$ choices of $w$ because $u$ has at most $\sqrt{m}$ neighbors.

    \item All vertices are large. The number of triangles of this type is clearly $(2\sqrt{m})^3 = 8m^{1.5}$.
